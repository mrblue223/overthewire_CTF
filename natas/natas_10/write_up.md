## Name: Natas Level 10 â†’ Level 11

## The Trick
Natas10 typically features a command injection vulnerability, where the web application uses user-supplied input directly within a system command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject shell metacharacters (like ;, |, &&) and append arbitrary commands to the original command. When the server executes this combined string, the injected commands are also run, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure (such as reading the password file for the next level), or further system compromise.

You can use "u" to bypass this -> "u /etc/natas_webpass/natas11"


## Vulnarability: command injection

We can input "u /etc/natas_webpass/natas11"
This will ouput the password for natas11

## Mitigation: 
To prevent command injection vulnerabilities like Natas10, the most effective strategy is strict input validation and sanitization. This means always whitelisting acceptable input, meticulously escaping all shell metacharacters if user input must be part of a command, and ideally, avoiding direct system calls in favor of safer, language-specific APIs. Additionally, running the web server with the principle of least privilege significantly limits the potential damage if an injection somehow occurs.
