## Mitigation: 
To mitigate file upload vulnerabilities like the one in Natas12, a multi-layered security approach is essential. First, never rely solely on client-side validation for file extensions or MIME types, as these can be easily bypassed. Implement server-side validation that uses an allow-list (whitelist) of explicitly permitted file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif for images) rather than a blacklist. Additionally, validate the actual file content (e.g., using getimagesize() for images) to ensure it truly matches the expected file type, preventing malicious files from masquerading as legitimate ones. Finally, store uploaded files outside of the web root directory to prevent direct execution via URL, and rename uploaded files with unique, non-guessable names to avoid overwriting existing files or enabling path traversal attacks.
