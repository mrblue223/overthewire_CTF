## The Trick: 

Craft a malicious PHP file, that allows for arbitrary command execution.
Add image magic bytes: Prepend the PHP script with the magic bytes of an image format (e.g., \xff\xd8\xff for JPEG). This makes the file look like a valid image to the server's validation.
Upload the crafted file: Upload this "polyglot" file to the server.
Locate the uploaded file: Determine the URL or path where the uploaded file is stored.
Execute commands: Access the uploaded file via its URL and pass commands as a GET parameter (e.g., http://natas13.natas.labs.overthewire.org/upload/your_file.php?cmd=cat+/etc/natas_webpass/natas14). This will execute the PHP code and display the output of the command.


## Vulnarability: File Upload Functionality & Insufficient File Type Validation & Bypass with Magic Bytes (File Signature) & Directory Traversal/Path Disclosure

Lets look at the sourc code shall we :)

First lets craft our pyaload! We add the magic bytes of the jpeg to the .php payload to trick the server into thinking its an image.

With burp suite intercept the payload while you upload it

Change the name of the payload to the original name in my case "image.php".

Upload it to the server and visit the link and voila you have the password.
