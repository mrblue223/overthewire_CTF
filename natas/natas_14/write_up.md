## The Trick: 

Natas 14 demonstrates a classic SQL Injection vulnerability where a web application directly incorporates user input into an SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. The injected code then manipulates the original query, often causing the database to return all records or bypass authentication, highlighting the critical need for developers to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent user input from being interpreted as executable code.
