Lets intercept the traffic with a tool like burpsuite to add a referer header to make it seem like where
comming from the website "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/".

After intercepting the traffic it should look like this after refreshing the page

Then we change the "Referer" header to "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/".
